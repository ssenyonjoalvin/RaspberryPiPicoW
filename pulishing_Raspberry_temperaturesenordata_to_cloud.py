    # QoS (Quality of Service) Levels: MQTT supports three levels of message delivery guarantees:
    # QoS 0 (At most once): Messages are delivered at most once, without retry if the client misses it. This is the most lightweight but risky in terms of missing messages.
    # QoS 1 (At least once): Messages are delivered at least once. The broker will keep trying to send the message until the client acknowledges it.
    # QoS 2 (Exactly once): The most reliable, ensures that messages are delivered exactly once by keeping track of each message, but has more overhead.
    # If youâ€™re using QoS 0, you must poll more frequently because missed messages are not retained.
    # If the interval is too short, your device might consume more power, especially for battery-powered IoT devices like the Pico W.
